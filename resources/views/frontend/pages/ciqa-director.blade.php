                            In the journey of human civilisation, we have witnessed the power of communications as the most
                            efficacious mechanism to deal with all our human relations, perceptions and knowledge for which
                            medium is the soul. Media convergence is a general phenomenon but in the Covid-19 period it
                            progressed at a rapid rate and made tremendous changes in content delivery patterns especially
                            in the education system. Founded in 2012, the school of Journalism Mass Communication and New
                            Media (SOJMC&NM) has formed and maintained its forward looking approach.

                            Versatile and experienced faculties from across the country have been a signature area of the
                            school in shaping employable competencies and human values in students. Members of our alumni
                            community, who are our ambassadors serve various organisations across India as media
                            professionals, PR professionals, script writers, photojournalists, documentary filmmakers,
                            advertising professionals, educators, media consultants, content developers, animators,
                            researchers and self-reliant entrepreneurs.

                            With our MA in New Media Communications and MA in Journalism and Mass Communication and Ph.D.
                            programmes, our school intends to prepare future ready professionals equipped with knowledge,
                            skills and values. Our dynamic curriculum structure enables us to integrate real-time updates by
                            adopting innovative pedagogical practices and an immersive education milieu. Apart from the
                            pedagogy our school contributes to the pursuit of knowledge creation through its high quality
                            research output which puts it higher in bibliometric indexes. Our discipline-based community
                            outreach practices are a step towards nurturing a knowledge society.

                            I convey my sincere regards to the previous deans, Prof. Pradeep Nair, an acknowledged scholar
                            in his discipline and Prof. Rabindranath Manukonda (now serving in JNU, New Delhi) for shaping
                            and making our school vibrant.

                            I wish all the very best in your future endeavours.
